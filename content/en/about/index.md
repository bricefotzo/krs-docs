## What makes Krs unique?
Krs is a Kubernetes cluster health monitoring and tools recommendation service. The primary goal of KRS is to provide insights into the current state of a Kubernetes cluster, identify potential issues, and suggest relevant tools and resources to enhance the cluster's efficiency and security.

The project is designed to work with a local or remote Kubernetes cluster, and it utilizes various data sources, such as CNCF tools, Kubernetes landscape, and LLM (Language Model) for contextual analysis. KRS aims to provide actionable recommendations based on the cluster's current state and the latest trends in the Kubernetes ecosystem.
