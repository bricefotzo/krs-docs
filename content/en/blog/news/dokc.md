## Prerequisites

- Digital Ocean Account
- Homebrew(if you're on Mac)

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup a Kubernetes Cluster on Digital Ocean

![DGO_Kube_Cluster](https://github.com/kubetoolsca/krs/assets/171302280/6bd344c8-1a3f-4006-b187-49f01d0f5e56)

### 2. Install and Setup doctl on your Local Machine

If on Ubuntu use:

```
sudo snap install doctl 
sudo snap connect doctl:kube-config
sudo snap connect doctl:ssh-keys :ssh-keys
sudo snap connect doctl:dot-docker
```

If on Mac, use:

```
brew install doctl 
```

### 3. Authenticate your Digital Ocean Account

```
doctl auth init
```

### 4. Connect your Local Machine to your Digital Ocean Kubernetes Cluster

```
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save ea3a5a97-fdba-4455-bd81-46df80c68267
```

### 5. Setup KRS using these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/kubetoolsca/krs.git
cd krs
pip install .
```

### 6. Initialize KRS to permit it access to your cluster using the given command,

```
krs init
```

### 7. Get a view of all possible actions with KRS, by running the given command
```
krs --help
```

```
krs --help

```
### 8. Permit KRS to get information on the tools utilized in your cluster by running the given command 

```
krs scan
```

```
krs scan

Scanning your cluster...

Cluster scanned successfully...

Extracted tools used in cluster...


The cluster is using the following tools:

+-------------+--------+------------------+---------------+
| Tool Name   |   Rank | Category         | CNCF Status   |
+=============+========+==================+===============+
| cilium      |      1 | Network Policies | graduated     |
+-------------+--------+------------------+---------------+
| hubble      |      7 | Security Tools   | listed        |
+-------------+--------+------------------+---------------+

```

### 9. Get recommendations on possible tools to use in your cluster by running the given command 

```
krs recommend
```

```
krs recommend

Our recommended tools for this deployment are:

+------------------+------------------------+-------------+---------------+
| Category         | Recommendation         | Tool Name   | CNCF Status   |

Checking status of the pod...

Extracting logs and events from the pod...

Logs and events from the pod extracted successfully!

>>  The log entries provided are empty {}, so there is nothing to analyze. Therefore, I can confirm that 'Everything looks good!' in this case.

If there were warnings or errors in the log entries, I would have analyzed them thoroughly to identify the root cause. Depending on the specific warnings or errors, potential steps to resolve the issues could include:

1. Analyzing the specific error message to understand the problem
2. Checking Kubernetes resources (e.g., pods, deployments, configmaps) for any misconfigurations
3. Verifying connectivity to external resources or dependencies
4. Checking for resource limitations or constraints that could be causing issues
5. Reviewing recent changes in the Kubernetes environment that could have introduced problems
6. Using Kubernetes troubleshooting tools like kubectl logs, describe, or events to gather more information 

By following these steps and addressing any identified issues, you can resolve warnings or errors in the Kubernetes environment.

>> Wonderful, anything else to note?
>>  In addition to resolving warnings or errors in Kubernetes logs, it's important to regularly monitor and maintain the Kubernetes environment to ensure smooth operation. Some best practices for Kubernetes maintenance include:

1. Regularly updating Kubernetes components and cluster nodes to the latest stable versions to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
2. Implementing automated backups of critical data and configurations to prevent data loss in case of failures.
3. Monitoring resource utilization and scaling components as needed to optimize performance and cost efficiency.
4. Implementing security best practices, such as network policies, RBAC, and pod security policies to protect the cluster from unauthorized access or malicious activities.
5. Conducting regular health checks and performance tuning to identify and address any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the cluster.
6. Developing a disaster recovery plan and testing it periodically to ensure business continuity in case of unexpected events.

By following these maintenance practices, you can ensure the stability, scalability, and security of your Kubernetes environment for optimal DevOps operations.

>> Alright, so are we done?
>>  Yes, we have covered the analysis of the Kubernetes log entries and discussed best practices for Kubernetes maintenance. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, we can consider this conversation complete.

>> Wonderful. Thanks! end chat
>>  You're welcome! If you have any more questions in the future, feel free to reach out. Have a great day! Goodbye!
